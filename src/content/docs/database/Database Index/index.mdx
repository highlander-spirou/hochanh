## What is database index?

The database store database as bits in a flat file. Therefore, the retrieval of data is a list-like traversal. Meaning, in order to get the the desired block, we have to scan the whole flat file block by block until we reaches the filtered condition.
For faster retrieval of data blocks, databases utilize index â€“ a data structure that traverse faster than a list-like data structure.

Two datastructures are implemented:

[B-tree Index]()

[LSM Tree Index]()
