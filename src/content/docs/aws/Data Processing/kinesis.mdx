`AWS Kinesis` is an all in one solution for stream processing. They includes three main services: `Kinesis Data Stream`, `Kinesis Firehose` and `Managed Flink Service` (renamed from `Kinesis Data Analysis`).

## Kinesis Data Stream

Kinesis data stream is a forked of Apache Kafka, that ables to natively connects with most of AWS services. There are three ways to stream data into Kinesis Data Stream:

**1. Amazon Kinesis Agent**

This is a Java app, that watches series of log files. Application append data into the log file, and the new data automatically sends to Kinesis Data Stream topic.

**2. AWS SDK for Java**

If you have a backend in Java (Spring boot), you can use the Java SDK to stream the data to Kinesis (or you create an external service)

**3. AWS Kinesis Producer Library (KPL)**

This is the same as Kinesis Agent. It is usually installed in an EC2, that send pseudo packet to test Kinesis


There are three services that is used for Kinesis Data Stream consumers, that is `Apache Flink`, `Kinesis Firehose` and `Kinesis Client Library (KCL)`. Flink is simple, it is a cluster of stream processing. KCL is like KPl, but for client EC2 machine.

## Kinesis Firehose

Kinesis is an no code environment for stream sinking. It takes a stream source (most likely Kinesis Data Stream) and dump the data to an AWS Service as sink. If you want a custom transformation, Kinesis triggers Lambda function. [See the template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-kinesisfirehose.html)
